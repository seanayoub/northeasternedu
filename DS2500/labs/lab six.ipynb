    "## Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to practice software design, the top-down process of taking some task and determining what objects / functions / data types to use to build it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our focus is on the projects at this time of the semester, I intend for this lab to be entirely complete within the alotted 100 min lab time (unless you're tackling an extra credit challenge).  My expectation is that many students will have completed the design and be working on the implementation when lab is over (per our rubric, this is sufficient for full credit!).  **Please focus your energy on writing a complete, well documented and simple design to implement tic-tac-take rather than worrying about completing the implementation during this lab!**\n",
    "\n",
    "While some implementations are obviously better than others, there's usually a few great ways to build any piece of software which are equivilently strong.  Moreover, I think the best way to learn why some approach isn't so great is to try it out.  **Don't be afraid of making a software design \"mistake\" here**: your approach needn't look like other students but I will ask that you spend all your brainpower refining your approach into the simplest form it can possibly be.\n",
