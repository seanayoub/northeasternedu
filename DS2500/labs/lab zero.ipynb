    "- be collaborative and kind\n",
    "    - ask questions of others\n",
    "    - invite questions from others\n",
    "- each student will submit their own lab file\n",
    "- please do not share code files \n",
    "    - however, unlike HW, you're welcome to look at each other's ungraded work\n",

Our goal is to build hangman so it can be played in jupyter.  (Admittedly, we can't hide the target word as easily for our game player ... but let's just not worry about this.)\n"
