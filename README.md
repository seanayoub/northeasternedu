## TO DO

Throughout the source code as comments noted with `TODO` indicating things that are still remaining
to be improved.

TO DO: in HTML file: making the links at the end into buttons/a static part of the 
page outside of the scrolly; additionally, fix the color so it's legible??? 

TO DO: in JS file: fix the step funtion, there's something screwy with making the 
steps active.

TO DO: in CSS file, error message for the footer styles

TO DO: Somewhere (JS?), the hamburger menu isn't a button/doesn't expand when clicked- solution is in Bootstrap.
