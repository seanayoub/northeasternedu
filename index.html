              At Raising a Reader, our mission is to close the literacy
              opportunity gap among children ages birth to six in
              under-resourced communities by helping families develop and
              practice shared home reading habits.
            </p>

          <div class="step" data-step="2">
            <p>
              More than thirty-five years of research shows that being regularly
              read to by a caregiver before Kindergarten is a significant factor
              impacting a child’s academic success. In Massachusetts, a child’s
              reading comprehension is tested for the first time in third grade,
              and the results are widely accepted by researchers as a predictor
              of both high school successes and college enrollment.
            </p>

          <div class="step" data-step="3">
            <p>
              Results from the 2023 Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment
              System (MCAS) prove that third graders are <b>not</b> reading
              proficiently, deeply impacting those in under-resourced
              communities.

              In point, this visualization will illustrate the difference
              between the ratio of books to children in middle income versus low
              income communities when toggled. In middle income communities, the
              ratio is 13 books to 1 child - in low income communities, it's 1
              book to 300 children.

              The most significant factor influencing a child’s early
              educational success is an introduction to books and being read to
              at home prior to beginning school. This is where we can help- by
              funding Raising a Reader's programs, children will receive the
              hands on support they need to read, learn, and thrive.
